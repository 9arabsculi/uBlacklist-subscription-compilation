WindPRO 2.7 54 covers everything from wind data analysis, calculation of energy yields, quantification of uncertainties, assessment of site suitability, to calculation and visualization of environmental impact. It can also be used for detailed post-construction analysis of production data. All available in separate modules as needed.
  
In this article, we will highlight some of the features and benefits of WindPRO 2.7 54 that make it a powerful tool for wind energy professionals.
  
## Wind Data Analysis
  
Wind data is the foundation of any wind farm project. WindPRO 2.7 54 allows you to screen, clean and repair wind data from various sources, such as met masts, lidars, sodars, or wind resource maps. You can also use multi-height met masts and multiple turbine hub heights to capture the vertical wind profile.
  
WindPRO 2.7 54 can perform various statistical analyses on the wind data, such as frequency distribution, Weibull fit, turbulence intensity, extreme winds, diurnal variation, seasonal variation, and more. You can also compare your wind data with long-term reference data from high-quality datasets delivered with WindPRO 2.7 54.
  
## Wind Modelling
  
Once you have your wind data ready, you can use WindPRO 2.7 54 to model the wind flow over your site terrain and obstacles. WindPRO 2.7 54 supports various wind flow models, such as WAsP, WAsP-CFD, CFD++, Fuga, Linearized RANS (LRANS), and more.
  
You can also use WindPRO 2.7 54 to find the optimal turbine configuration for your site. You can select the right wind turbine model from a catalogue of over 1.000 models approved by manufactures. You can also handle complex wind turbine operation modes with thousands of power curves.
  
WindPRO 2.7 54 can calculate the energy production of your wind farm using either time series or wind statistics as you like in the PARK module. You can also estimate the losses due to wake effects, electrical losses, availability losses, environmental losses, etc.
  
## Post-Construction Analysis
  
WindPRO 2.7 54 can also help you to analyze your operational data after the construction of your wind farm. You can use the PERFORMANCE CHECK module to compare the actual production data with the expected production data from WindPRO 2.7 54.
  
You can also use WindPRO 2.7 54 to evaluate the performance of individual turbines or groups of turbines in your wind farm. You can identify underperforming turbines or potential faults by using various indicators, such as power curve deviation, availability factor, capacity factor, etc.
  
## Environment
  
WindPRO 2.7 54 can also help you to assess and mitigate the environmental impact of your wind farm project. You can use WindPRO 2.7 54 to calculate and visualize the noise impact of your wind farm using simple or sophisticated noise models.
  
You can also use WindPRO 2.7 54 to calculate and visualize the shadow flicker impact of your wind farm using detailed shadow maps and calendars. You can also use WindPRO 2.7 54 to calculate and visualize the visual impact of your wind farm using zone of visual influence (ZVI) maps and photomontages.
  
## Loads
  
WindPRO 2.7 54 can also help you to evaluate the loads on your wind turbines on a particular site. You can use the SITE COMPLIANCE module to check if your site conditions are within the design limits of your selected turbine model.
  
You can also use the LOAD RESPONSE module to estimate the design loads and expected lifetime of your turbine components based on site-specific wind conditions and turbulence levels.
