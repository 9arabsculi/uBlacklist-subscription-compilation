In this article, we will explain how to license ProModel Software (including Process Simulator) in two ways: using a software key or using a hardware key. We will also show you how to verify that your software is licensed correctly.
 
## Using a Software Key
 
A software key is a code that you enter in the ProModel Software activation wizard. You can get a software key online or by contacting ProModel Technical Support. To use a software key, follow these steps:
 
1. Install ProModel Software on your computer.
2. Launch ProModel Software. You will see the activation wizard.
3. Select "I want to activate the software over the Internet" and click Next.
4. Enter your serial number and click Next.
5. If you have a software key, enter it and click Next. If you don't have a software key, click "Get License Key Online".
6. If you clicked "Get License Key Online", you will be directed to a web page where you need to enter your serial number and email address. Click Submit and you will receive a software key by email.
7. Enter the software key in the activation wizard and click Next.
8. Click Finish to complete the activation.

## Using a Hardware Key
 
A hardware key is a USB device that you plug into your computer. You need to install a driver for the hardware key before using it. To use a hardware key, follow these steps:

1. Install ProModel Software on your computer.
2. Install the driver for the hardware key from the ProModel Software CD or download it from [https://www.promodel.com/support/hardwarekey.asp](https://www.promodel.com/support/hardwarekey.asp).
3. Plug the hardware key into your computer.
4. Launch ProModel Software. You will see the activation wizard.
5. Select "I have a hardware key" and click Next.
6. Click Finish to complete the activation.

## Verifying that Your Software Is Licensed
 
To verify that your software is licensed correctly, follow these steps:

1. Launch ProModel Software.
2. Select Help > About from the menu bar.
3. You will see a dialog box that shows your serial number, license type, and expiration date (if applicable).
4. If your license type is "Hardware Key", make sure that your hardware key is plugged in and recognized by your computer.
5. If your license type is "Software Key", make sure that your software key matches your serial number.

## Benefits of Process Simulation
 
Process simulation can provide many benefits for manufacturing and manufacturing-related processes. Some of the benefits are:

- Improve your processes for an efficient workflow. Process simulation enables users to visualize the business processes by considering every component, including employees involved in the process, resources allocated, activities done, and the time of these activities. By simulating the process, you can identify and eliminate bottlenecks, reduce cycle times, improve resource utilization, and increase productivity and quality[^1^].
- Advance your process models for low risk and cost. Process simulation allows you to test different process designs and scenarios without affecting the real system. You can experiment with various parameters, such as demand, capacity, layout, scheduling, and inventory levels, and compare the results in terms of performance indicators, such as throughput, cost, service level, and profitability[^2^]. This way, you can find the optimal solution for your process with minimal risk and cost.
- Customize your processes for a better customer experience. Process simulation can help you understand how your processes affect your customers and their satisfaction. You can simulate different customer behaviors, preferences, and expectations, and see how they impact your process outcomes. You can also simulate different service levels, delivery times, and quality standards, and see how they affect your customer loyalty and retention[^1^]. By using process simulation, you can tailor your processes to meet your customer needs and expectations.
